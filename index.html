          Easily record all your purchases and sales in one place. GreenSense
          keeps track of seeds, fertilizers, supplies, and crop sales so you

        <p>
          GreenSense analyzes your data to show which crops are most profitable,
          where costs are too high, and what trends are emerging. This helps you
          make better planting and selling decisions based on real performance,
          not guesswork.

          View simple charts and summaries that show your farm’s health at a
          glance. Get alerts when costs increase, crops underperform, or when a
          profitable opportunity appears, so you can act quickly and
          confidently.
